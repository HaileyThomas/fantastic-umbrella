* Fantastic Umbrella is a back end project to help practice mysql and sequelize databases! We were provided with the starter code and it was our job to create a database for an ecommerce store. 
* To create the database, my first step was making sure the schema was correct, and that we had an .env to log into mysql safely.
* After the initial database was created, I ten went in and filled out our Model classes for Categories, Products, Tags and Product Tags. Once the Models were finished I used sequelize to create associations between the models.
* The next step was to create our API routes, making sure we followed CRUD and being able to create, read, update and delete.
* After all our code was finshed I tested everything in Insomnia to ensure that everything worked!
